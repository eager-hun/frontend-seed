 * Mixins vs Extending utility-role Placeholders?
 *
 * Mixins won, placeholders lost so badly that they will not be used. Repetition
 * originating from using mixins will be mitigated by gzip serving the resulting
 * files (gzip works well on repeated patterns, they say).
 *
 * @see
 * http://www.sitepoint.com/avoid-sass-extend/
 * http://csswizardry.com/2014/11/when-to-use-extend-when-to-use-a-mixin/
 *
 * NOTES on basic syntax:
 * @code
 *   @mixin test-mixin--box($bg: gold, $padding: 1em) {
 *     background: $bg;
 *     padding: $padding;
 *
 *     @if $bg == (gold) and $padding == (1em) {
 *       border: 1px solid red;
 *     }
 *     @else if $bg == (gold) and $padding != (1em) {
 *       border: 5px solid red;
 *     }
 *     @else {
 *       border: 3px solid black;
 *     }
 *   }
 * @endcode
