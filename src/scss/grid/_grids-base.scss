/**

 * Establishment of grid-related classes.
 *
 * This setup was primarily made for on-demand-grids. It is when we do not
 * automatically generate a series of HTML classes (pre-generated grid), but
 * instead, establish grid behavior by using grid-related sass-mixins when
 * neccessary.
 *
 * Even though 'row' and 'column' behavior can be achieved via just mixins,
 * it might still make sense to pre-define .row and .column classes, so these
 * classes still can be used in the markup.
 *
 * Also, it may still be useful to pre-define some tailor-made grid-related
 * classes to support reusing simple-enough grid patterns accross multiple
 * components.
